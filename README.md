# Crow Game

In a world where Crowe's lands are threatened by aliens enveloping the world in socks. Only you can help him make it to Becky!

### How to play:

To help Crowe, you have to control his movements. To move back and forwth, you simply use the arrow keys. To shoot, you must use the space bar. Be careful however, because Crowe can only shoot once until he sees that his shot is off the screen.
